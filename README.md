# Multilabel Glass Classification Deep Learning

## Tasks
Perform an initial analysis of the data (EDA) using python in your Jupyter notebook. Discuss your findings and what relevance they might have on your planned Neural Network model.
Perform any preparation of the data, that you feel is necessary, using python in your Jupyter notebook. Explain your rationale behind your data preparation and how it will assist you.
Create and implement a Neural Network that will output a classification based on the Type of glass: (class attribute) feature. Test this model and try to improve it using different configurations of neurons/layers/loss functions/activation functions and discuss your findings and final rational for the Neural network configuration.
Make a classification using your test data, using your final Neural Network configuration and comment on the accuracy differential between the training and testing set.
